This package contains 10 different farm buildings, 5 machines
like traktor and harvester, some modular walls and more than
10 smaller props,

Machines are not animateable!

Just drag the prefabs into your scene and arrange them as you like.

You may also want to have a look at the example scene that contains all the prefabs.

All machine textures were created including ambient occlusion.

Collision-meshes are also included.

The original FBX-files are also included in the package.
